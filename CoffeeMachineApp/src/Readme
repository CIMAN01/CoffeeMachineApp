A coffee machine app that makes 3 types of coffee drinks (epresso, latte, and cappucino drinks).

The user interacts with the machine via a menu that takes that lets your order a drink, collects funds, and stock up on supplies, 
as well as display the status on those funds and supplies.

While the machine can be used to charge and collect money, the transactions are in digital nature only. 

Also, when refilling supplies the machine only has a limited capacity, and will therefore not accept any excessive amount of supplies 
that is entered. 

Lastly, the menu is built in a way so that it will display errors if user enters anything that is invalid or out the boundaries of the 
given instructions (in which case the console will prompt user again for another input).

The program uses coffee objects to keep track of all changes that are made by user and basic recursive method calls that make the 
menu selections work as long user desired until they type exit.
